- **Movements**: Dispatches and rentals with customer information
- **Returns**: Return records with quantities and dates
- **Users**: System users with roles and permissions

### Business Logic
- Stock levels automatically adjust with dispatches and returns
- Overdue tracking based on expected return dates
- Role-based UI rendering and action availability
- Real-time statistics calculation

## 🚧 Development Notes

- **Frontend Only**: No backend or database (data resets on refresh)
- **Mock Authentication**: Simple role selection without real security
- **In-Memory Storage**: All data stored in browser memory
- **No Persistence**: Data is lost when the page is refreshed

### Future Enhancements
- Backend API integration
- Real authentication and authorization
- Database persistence
- Real-time notifications
- Advanced reporting features
- Mobile app companion

## 🎨 Customization

```css
:root {
  --primary: 0 0% 9%;
  --secondary: 0 0% 96.1%;
  /* ... other variables */
}
```

### Components
All UI components are built with shadcn/ui and can be customized in the `components/ui/` directory.

## 📈 Performance

- **Optimized Bundle**: Tree-shaking and code splitting
- **Fast Navigation**: Client-side routing with Next.js
- **Efficient State**: Zustand for minimal re-renders
- **Responsive Images**: Next.js Image optimization
